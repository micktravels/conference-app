This document is a supplementary guide to the conference.py app.
It explains the design choices in each of the four tasks.

TASK 1:  ADD SESSIONS TO CONFERENCE
There is a direct analogy between user-conference and conference-session.
Code was heavily borrowed from the Conference Objects section of the app.
Noteable modifications include:
  * New Session, SessionForm and SessionForms classes in models.py.
    The Session class stores a websafekey of the parent conference
    The SessionForm(s) additionally takes a websafekey of the Session
	just like ConferenceForm(s) does with it own websafekeys.
	It also holds the conference name for user convenience.
    I used a DateProperty for the Session Date and a TimeProperty for
	the session startTime.
  * createSession differs from createConference in a few ways:
    Special logic to convert dates and times to DateProperty and TimeProperty
	in the new createSession method
    No internal _create function for a shell to call.  Just do it all in one.
    Verify that the session date falls within the conference
    The session keys are built with conference key as parent

TASK 2:  ADD SESSIONS TO USER WISHLIST
This task is analogous to conference registration, from where I borrowed
a lot of the code.
Noteable modifications include:
  * Profile class modified to include a Session Wishlist.  This is a
    repeatable field of session websafekeys
  * Added both an add-to and remove-from wishlist functions for convenience

TASK 3:  WORK ON INDEXES AND QUERIES
Two new queries that my conference.py app supports:
  1) List all conferences in a given city
  2) List all sessions that begin after 10:00a in case you want to sleep in
